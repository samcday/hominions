# hominions

Hopefully, this repo will be the place where I manage all of the digital devices in my life, GitOps-style.

 * [boot-cluster](./boot-cluster/README.md): a small k8s cluster made up of old phones running postmarketOS.
 * (soon?) services-cluster: a k8s cluster made up of old onsite x86 machines (currently: my old Librem Purism 13v2) and autoscaling hcloud compute.
 * [headscale](./headscale): my self-hosted Tailscale control-plane
