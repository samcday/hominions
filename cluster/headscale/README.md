# headscale

A "self-hosted" deployment of [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) which runs the control-plane for my personal Tailnet.

It's currently running on Fly.io, using Litestream (classic) to replicate the SQLite DB to Backblaze.

In future, if I can figure out how to IPv6 properly on my home network, I might consider trying to run this myself.
